        // to create a field element from 753 random bits, we may get an invalid value back (in this
        // case it is just all zeros). There are two options to deal with this:
        // 1) To create finite field elements, using 753 random bits, in a loop until a valid one
        //    is created.
        // 2) Use only 752 random bits to create a finite field element. This will guaranteedly
        //    produce a valid element on the first try, but will reduce the entropy of the EC
        //    point generation by one bit.
        // We chose the second one because we believe the entropy reduction is not significant enough.
