/// This section has methods that implement the Tendermint protocol as described in the original
/// paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938v3).
/// We made three modifications:
/// 1) For each round, we only accept the first proposal that we receive. Since Tendermint is
///    designed to work even if the proposer sends different proposals to each node, and the nodes
///    don't rebroadcast the proposals they receive, we can safely ignore any subsequent proposals
///    that we receive after the first one.
/// 2) We only accept valid proposals to begin with, so we don't need to check the validity of the
///    proposal during the protocol.
/// 3) The protocol assumes that we are always listening for proposals and precommit messages, and
///    if we receive any proposal with 2f+1 precommits accompanying it, we are supposed to accept it
///    and terminate. We don't do this. Instead we assume that the validator crate will be listening
///    for completed blocks and will terminate Tendermint when it receives one.
/// These two modifications allows us to refactor the Tendermint protocol from its original message
/// passing form into the state machine form that we use.
