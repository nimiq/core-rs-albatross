/// macro blocks since genesis plus the last macro block (most likely it will be a checkpoint block,
/// but it might be an election block). For these macro blocks the node must also get the
/// corresponding history tree. When the macro blocks are synced, then the node gets all the micro
/// blocks in the current batch and pushes them normally.
/// Note that, when pushing the macro blocks, we rely on the assumption that they were produced by
/// honest validator sets (defined as having less than 1/3 malicious validators). Because of that
/// we don't actually check the validity of the blocks, we just perform the minimal amount of checks
/// necessary to verify that the given block is a successor of our current chain so far and that the
