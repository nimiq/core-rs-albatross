// Multiple things this needs to take care of when it comes to what needs signing here:
// First of all to be able to create a block proof the signatures must be over a hash which includes:
// * block-height
// * tendermint round
// * proposal hash (calculated using the `zkp_hash` function)
// * implicit: TendermintStep which also works as the prefix for the specific message which is signed (read purpose byte)
//
// In addition to that the correct assignment of specific contributions to their aggregations also needs part of this information.
// Additionally replay of any given contribution for a different aggregation must not be possible.
// * network
// * block_height
// * round_number
// * step
//
// in summary, the tag which Handel will be working on will be `TendermintIdentifier`
// The signature will then be over the following serialized values (in order):
// `id.step(also prefix) + id.block_number + id.round_number + proposal.header.hash() + create_merkle_root()`
// Note that each one of those is fixed size and thus no overflow from one to the next can be constructed.
//
// The proof needs to contain additional miscellaneous information then, as it would otherwise be lost to time:
// * round_number
//
// that can be included plain text as the proof alongside it also contains it.
