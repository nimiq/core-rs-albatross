/// This is the leaf subcircuit of the PKTreeCircuit. This circuit main function is to process the
/// validator's public keys and "return" the aggregate public key for the Macro Block. At a
/// high-level, it divides all the computation into 2^n parts, where n is the depth of the tree, so
/// that each part uses only a manageable amount of memory and can be run on consumer hardware.
/// It does this by forming a binary tree of recursive SNARKs. Each of the 2^n leaves receives
/// Merkle tree commitments to the public keys list and a commitment to the corresponding aggregate
/// public key chunk (there are 2^n chunks, one for each leaf) in addition the position of the leaf
/// node on the tree (in little endian bits) and the part of the signer's bitmap relevant to the
/// leaf position. Each of the leaves then checks that its specific chunk of the public keys,
/// aggregated according to its specific chunk of the signer's bitmap, matches the corresponding
/// chunk of the aggregated public key.
/// All of the other upper levels of the recursive SNARK tree just verify SNARK proofs for its child
/// nodes and recursively aggregate the aggregate public key chunks (no pun intended).
/// At a lower-level, this circuit does two things:
///     1. That the public keys given as witness are a leaf of the Merkle tree of public keys, in a
///        specific position. The Merkle tree root and the position are given as inputs and the
///        Merkle proof is given as a witness.
///     2. That the public keys given as witness, when aggregated according to the signer's bitmap
///        (given as an input), match the aggregated public key commitment (also given as an input).
