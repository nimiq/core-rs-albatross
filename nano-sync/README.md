# Nano Sync
Nano sync is a library that implements the zero knowledge proof part of Nimiq's Nano Sync.
Specifically, it contains code that allows one to generate parameters, create proofs and verify proofs for several circuits
that together create a chain of proofs that can be used to recursively prove the entire header chain starting at the
Genesis block.

## Circuits
At a very high level, we use Recursive SNARKs to compress the work of verifying many blocks into a single short proof. Our
setup also allows us to update a proof when a new block comes in, without having knowledge of the past blocks. We only need
the previous proof and the new block.

We perform SNARK proofs on the MNT4/6 elliptic curve cycle (specifically the MNT4-753 and MNT6-753 curves). We
can use the MNT4 curve to prove statements in the MNT6 curve and vice-versa (you can find an in-depth introduction to
recursive SNARKs [here](https://www.michaelstraka.com/posts/recursivesnarks/)).

This library consists of several circuits that, when chained together, can recursively prove the validity of many blocks.
The image below illustrates that:

The arrows represent that the proof generated by one circuit is given as input to another circuit. A brief description of
each circuit:

* __Macro Block Circuit__: This circuit verifies the validity of a single block.
* __Macro Block Wrapper Circuit__: This circuit verifies a SNARK proof of the Macro Block circuit. It is used
to _wrap_ the Macro Block proof into the MNT6 curve so that it can be fed into the Merger circuit.
* __Merger Circuit__: This circuit verifies two SNARK proofs. It is used to _merge_ two different proofs into a single one.
* __Merger Wrapper Circuit__: This circuit verifies a SNARK proof of the Merger circuit. It is used
to _wrap_ the Merger proof into the MNT6 curve so that it can be fed into the Merger circuit.

Note that the MNT6 curve is only used for the wrapper circuits. We do this because the MNT6 curve is less efficient and 
can't handle large circuits, so we use it only with the smallest circuits.

### Macro Block Circuit
The macro block circuit attests that there exists a block that causes a valid state transition. Since there are 512
validators in a block, it isn't possible to process all of their public keys inside of a single circuit. So the macro block
circuit outsources the aggregation of the public keys to a tree of recursive SNARK circuits, that we call the PK Tree,
which we will explore later.

The macro block circuit takes as public inputs an initial state commitment and a final state commitment. The state commitment
is a commitment to the block number and all the public keys of the validators. To compute it first we calculate the root
of a Merkle tree over the public keys. Then we serialize the root and the block number, and create a Pedersen commitment
from it.

The macro block circuit takes as private inputs:

* The macro block, which itself consists of the hash of block header and the signatures and the bitmaps for the two
rounds of signing.
* The block number for the initial state.
* The roots of the Merkle trees over the public keys (which we will call the PK trees) of the initial and final states.
* The aggregate public keys for both rounds of PBFT signing (these are necessary to verify the BLS signatures on the
macro block). These are calculated by adding the public keys of all the validators that signed the block. These are
actually given as "chunks", which are simply the aggregate public keys for a subset of the validators (for this specific
case it's two chunks, one for each half of the validator list). This "chunking" is done for efficiency reasons.
* A SNARK proof for the PK Tree circuit. This proof verifies that the aggregate public keys provided as private inputs,
were correctly calculated from the list of validator public keys and the signer bitmaps.

The following image illustrates the inner workings of the macro block circuit. Notice that the public and private inputs
have different shapes in the diagram.

### PK Tree Circuits
The purpose of the PK Tree is to check that the aggregate public keys, for the prepare and commit rounds, given as
private inputs in the macro block circuit are correct. The actual calculation is quite simple, we simply add the public
keys of all the validators that signed the block, which can be checked easily using the signer bitmaps. The problem is
that a circuit that processes all of the 512 public keys would be too large and would be impossible to run in a normal
computer. So we divide the aggregation into 32 parts (16 keys per part) and then have 5 levels of circuits that merge
the 32 proofs into a single one. In the end it forms a tree:

### Wrapper Circuits
The wrapper circuits, both for the macro block and for the merger, attest that there is SNARK proof for the circuit that
they are wrapping.

They have the same public inputs as the circuit that they are wrapping. But they have a single private input, the SNARK
proof for the circuit that they are wrapping.

As an example, the following image shows the macro block wrapper circuit:

### Merger Circuit
The merger circuit attests that there are two SNARK proofs that prove the existence of two valid state transitions, first
from the initial state to an intermediate state and then from that intermediate state to the final state. In practical terms,
it verifies one proof from the Macro Block Wrapper circuit and one proof from the Merger Wrapper circuit.

This circuit takes as public inputs an initial state commitment, a final state commitment and a verifying key commitment.
The state commitments were already explained in the Macro Block circuit section. The verifying key commitment is a commitment
to the verifying key to the Merger Wrapper circuit. This commitment is needed because unfortunately the Merger Wrapper
verifying key cannot be hard-coded as a constant like the verifying keys for the other circuits.

As private inputs the Merger circuit takes:
* The SNARK proofs for the Merger Wrapper and Macro Block Wrapper circuits.
* The verifying key for the Merger Wrapper. This will be checked against the verifying key commitment given as public input.
* An intermediate state commitment. If the initial state is _0_ and the final state is _N_, then the intermediate state
should be _N-1_.
* The genesis flag. This is a boolean flag that is meant to indicate if a given instance of the merger circuit is verifying
the genesis block. Note that if we are verifying the genesis block, then this is the first Merger circuit in the SNARK chain
and there is no Merger Wrapper proof to verify. If this flag is set to true then the circuit will not verify the SNARK
proof for the Merger Wrapper but it will enforce that the initial state and the intermediate state must be equal. If the
flag is set to false then the reverse will happen.

The following image shows the details of the merger circuit:
